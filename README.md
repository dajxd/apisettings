# ApiSettings

## A little app for creating and saving "presets" for the API 7800 Channel Strip.

I used to keep all the numbers for different instruments and situations in a notebook, but now I've got a (not very) pretty GUI to do it in! All it does is remember where you set the knobs, and give you a list of saved settings to return to.
